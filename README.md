# Web Development 2 - CA2: Version Control
This is my homework, where I needed to create a public github repository and add different kinds of things to it like:
- At least one commit.
- At least one tag.
- A development branch, in addition to the main/master branch.
- A README.md file in the root folder, where you briefly describe what is your project about.
- A LICENSE file in the root folder that explains what people can do with your code. Examples: ISC, MIT, GPL, etc.
